Chayzer Chording keyboard

Board that I designed to be used with the https://artsey.io chording layout. Of course this can be modified to work in other ways "macro pad" etc.

When using an OLED screen on the pcb, make sure the pin's match, there are some versions that you can buy that have the wrong pin locations for this board

If you use the latter, you will have to somehow twist the pins around without having them touch... (not easy and can dammage it)
```
Supposed to be (looking from the top):
GND VCC SCL SDA

NOT:
VCC GND SCL SDA
```
